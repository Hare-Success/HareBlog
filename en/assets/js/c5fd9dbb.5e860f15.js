We are doing small batches every week but will increase the load shortly, so please be patient and keep an eye out in your mailbox, you\'ll be contacted as soon as your Algolia app is ready!\\n\\n### Where can I read more about this?\\n\\nWe wrote a small [migration guide](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/migrating-from-legacy) but you\'ll have more detailed information in the migration email.\\n\\n### I received the migration email but the invite expired\\n\\nPlease contact us via either [email](mailto:docsearch@algolia.com) or [DocSearch\'s Discord](https://discord.gg/bRTacwYrfX) or on [Docusaurus\'s Discord #algolia channel](https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus)\\n\\n### I have feedback!\\n\\nFor any feedback regarding our documentation or the DocSearch UI component, you can open an issue [on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/issues), but also contact us via the methods above.\\n\\n### Can I still run my own DocSearch instance?\\n\\nIn favor of the new infrastructure and DocSearch v3, we will no longer maintain our beloved [DocSearch scraper](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-scraper) and [DocSearch v2](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/tree/master), but the repositories will still be available and open to pull requests.\\n\\nThe previous documentation (now called `legacy`) remains available as well as our [`run your own`](https://docsearch.algolia.com/docs/legacy/run-your-own) guide."},{"id":"/2021/05/12/announcing-docusaurus-two-beta","metadata":{"permalink":"/en/blog/2021/05/12/announcing-docusaurus-two-beta","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/main/website/blog/2021/05-12-announcing-docusaurus-two-beta/index.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021/05-12-announcing-docusaurus-two-beta/index.mdx","title":"Announcing Docusaurus 2 Beta","description":"After a lengthy alpha stage in order to ensure feature parity and quality, we are excited to officially release the first Docusaurus 2 beta.","date":"2021-05-12T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Release","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/release","description":"Blog posts about Docusaurus\' new releases"},{"inline":false,"label":"Beta","permalink":"/en/blog/tags/beta"}],"readingTime":3.19,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"S\xe9bastien Lorber","title":"Docusaurus maintainer, This Week In React editor","url":"https://thisweekinreact.com","socials":{"x":"sebastienlorber","linkedin":"sebastienlorber","github":"slorber","newsletter":"https://thisweekinreact.com"},"imageURL":"./img/slorber.png","key":"slorber","image_url":"./img/slorber.png"},{"name":"Joel Marcey","title":"Developer Advocate at Meta","url":"https://twitter.com/JoelMarcey","email":"jimarcey@gmail.com","socials":{"x":"joelmarcey","github":"JoelMarcey"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/JoelMarcey.png","key":"JMarcey"},{"name":"Yangshun Tay","title":"Front End Engineer at Meta","url":"https://github.com/yangshun","email":"tay.yang.shun@gmail.com","socials":{"x":"yangshunz","github":"yangshun"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/yangshun.png","key":"yangshun"},{"name":"Alexey Pyltsyn","title":"Open-source enthusiast","url":"https://github.com/lex111","email":"lex@php.net","imageURL":"https://github.com/lex111.png","key":"lex111"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Announcing Docusaurus 2 Beta","authors":[{"key":"slorber","image_url":"./img/slorber.png","imageURL":"./img/slorber.png"},"JMarcey","yangshun","lex111"],"tags":["release","beta"],"image":"./img/social-card.png"},"unlisted":false,"lastUpdatedAt":1721906240000,"lastUpdatedBy":"wangfuyang","prevItem":{"title":"DocSearch migration","permalink":"/en/blog/2021/11/21/algolia-docsearch-migration"}},"content":"After a lengthy alpha stage in order to ensure feature parity and quality, we are excited to officially release the first **[Docusaurus 2 beta](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.0)**.\\n\\nWith the announcement of this beta, the team is even more confident that Docusaurus 2 is **ready for mainstream adoption**!\\n\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Docusaurus adoption\\n\\n**Don\'t fear the beta tag!**\\n\\nDocusaurus 2 is widely adopted and growing fast:\\n\\n\\nTo get a fuller understanding of the quality of current Docusaurus 2 sites, our new [showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase) page allows you to filter Docusaurus sites by features, so you may get inspired by real-world production sites with a similar use-case as yours!\\n\\nDon\'t miss our [favorite](https://docusaurus.io/showcase?tags=favorite) sites; they all stand out with something unique:\\n\\n\\n## Why was Docusaurus v2 in alpha for so long?\\n\\nIt\'s hard to believe that the first alpha release [v2.0.0-alpha.0](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/releases/tag/v2.0.0-alpha.0) was 2 years ago \ud83d\ude33 , unusually long for a software alpha.\\n\\nAs this was a substantial re-architecture of the code base, we wanted to ensure that we had confidence in the stability and features of Docusaurus 2 before moving on to a beta stage, since beta suggests a high level of quality. We are happy to say that Docusaurus 2 has reached **feature parity** with Docusaurus 1 with **[i18n](https://docusaurus.io/blog/2021/03/09/releasing-docusaurus-i18n)**, and it has been **successfully adopted** by many Docusaurus sites (see [i18n showcase](https://docusaurus.io/showcase?tags=i18n)).\\n\\nWe\'re now quite confident that the core features of Docusaurus 2 are stable enough to be in beta.\\n\\n## What are the goals of the beta?\\n\\nNow that Docusaurus 2 is stable and major feature complete, the goal of the beta is to inspire confidence in new users on the production-readiness of Docusaurus 2, migrate more remaining Docusaurus 1 users to version 2, and officially deprecate Docusaurus 1. We will, of course, continue to resolve any issues and bugs that may be discovered.\\n\\nIn addition, we will use the beta phase to **improve our theming system**.\\n\\nWe want to make it:\\n\\n- **easier to implement a custom theme**, including for ourselves. We want to provide [multiple official themes](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3522) (including [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2961)) for a long time.\\n\\n- **safer to extend an existing theme**: it can be painful to upgrade a highly customized Docusaurus site, as customizations can conflict with internal changes. We need to make the theme public API surface more explicit, and make it clear what is safe to customize.\\n\\nWe will build a better **theming infrastructure** and refactor the classic theme to use it.\\n\\nIf you customize your site, you may find these planned improvements quite valuable.\\n\\n## What\'s new?\\n\\nIn case you missed it, we recently shipped two major improvements:\\n\\n- [Auto-generated sidebars](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#sidebar-item-autogenerated): no need to maintain a `sidebars.js` file anymore!\\n- [Webpack 5 / PostCSS 8](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4027): persistent caching significantly speeds up **rebuild time**!\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nShipping the official 2.0 release!\\n\\nTo get there, we will continue to **fix bugs** and implement the **most wanted features**, including:\\n\\n- [Sidebar category index pages](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2643)\\n- [Better mobile navigation UX](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2220)\\n- [Better admonition design](https://github.com/facebookincubator/infima/issues/55)\\n- [CSS-in-JS support](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3236)\\n- [Improve build time performance](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4765)\\n- [Extend Docusaurus plugins, CMS integration](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4138)\\n- [Fix trailing slashes and relative link issues](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3372)\\n- [Better compatibility with CommonMark](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3018)\\n- [Upgrade to MDX 2.0](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/4029)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis is an exciting time for Docusaurus.\\n\\nWe are inspired by the [positive feedback](https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/timelines/1392048416872706049) about Docusaurus, and discover new sites online every single day.\\n\\nWe are so excited for this beta release. We strove for quality and stability while continuing to try to increase the adoption of Docusaurus. For those that have been on the fence from migrating an existing Docusaurus site to Docusaurus 2, it is a great time to upgrade. We want you running on the latest infrastructure when we deprecate Docusaurus 1 at the end of this beta period. Let us know how we can help.\\n\\nThank you to everyone for reading and to the entire community who supports Docusaurus. \ud83e\udd17"}]}}')}}]);
